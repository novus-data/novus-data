/**
 * Every fact the site states about Novus Data and its author lives in this
 * file. Nothing factual is written inline in a page component.
 *
 * Why it is built this way
 * -----------------------
 * Rule 1 of the build brief forbids fabricated facts, and Rule 6 forbids
 * hand-edits when something changes. Centralising the facts satisfies both:
 * there is exactly one place to correct a claim, and a claim that has not
 * been supplied is `null` rather than invented.
 *
 * `INPUT_LEDGER` in ./input-ledger.ts records where each fact came from. A
 * fact marked `assumed` was drafted from the project description and still
 * needs the author's confirmation; a fact marked `unanswered` is `null` and the
 * site renders around its absence instead of filling the gap.
 *
 * This module is deliberately free of side effects, because it is imported by a
 * client component (the wordmark). The build-time readiness check that used to
 * live here now lives in ./input-ledger.ts, which only server code imports —
 * running a module-load assertion in the browser crashes hydration, which is
 * exactly what happened before it was moved.

  openingBody:
    'A drought at a canal, a strike at a terminal, a licence withheld on one processed metal: none of it stays where it happens. It travels through the ships, ports, contracts and inventories that every business now sits downstream of, and it surfaces somewhere far from where it started, usually as a cost, a delay or a missed quarter. Novus Data follows it the whole way: from the disruption, to the lane, to the company.',

  positioning:
    'A disruption in physical trade reaches a company’s results by a route that can be traced.

An assessment that cannot supply all four is not published — it is dropped by the site itself, not left to editorial discretion.',
    'The work is reading rather than modelling. Novus Data does not run a proprietary dataset and does not publish forecasts dressed as numbers. Where something is uncertain, it is marked as inferred or estimated rather than stated flatly.',

It is easy to write that a company is "exposed" to a problem; it is much harder to say by what mechanism, how well established that is, and when it was last checked.
