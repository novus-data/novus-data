/**
 * Everything written for the site — briefings, articles and long-term
 * reviews — as JSON Feed 1.1.
 *
 * §14.2 listed an issues feed as "a reasonable reading convenience, still
 * unbuilt". The app prototype's Read screen is what made it necessary: an
 * app that shows the writing needs a machine-readable list of it, and
 * without one its reading list would be invented.
 *
 * Summaries only, never bodies. A post's full text lives on its page, which
 * is where its canonical URL, its print behaviour and its subscribe prompt
 * are; a feed that republished bodies would be a second copy to keep right.
 *
 * `id` is the slug — permanent and unique, enforced by the content layer —
 * so a client can store it. `_novus.kind` says which list a post belongs to.
 * Statically generated, like everything else that is not live.
