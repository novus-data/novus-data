              natural hazards, port wind and energy prices. Each carries the name of its source, a
              link to it, and the time the <em>source</em> produced the data, which is not the same
              as when the page was built. Each is marked delayed or stale against that
              source&rsquo;s own normal update cycle. A feed that fails shows as unavailable, with

              previous seven days. It counts reporting, not events. A place counts only reporting
              placed within its own stated radius, drawn to leave out large cities whose news is
              not about it, and a city with no measurable normal is listed but never flagged.
              Flags are published rules
              firing on readings — every rule is printed on the monitor — and a flag is a reason to
              look, not a finding.
