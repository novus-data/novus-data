/**
 * The live snapshot, machine-readable — the same data /monitor renders.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *
 * /register.json is the seam for alerts on the register (§6c). This is the
 * same seam for live readings: a separate watcher service (§14.2) can poll
 * it, compare against what it saw last, and decide whether anything crossed a
 * line a reader asked to hear about. The site does not do that deciding —
 * it stays a publication.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE TWO FIELDS A CONSUMER MUST READ
 *
 * `asOf` on each reading is when the SOURCE produced the data, taken from
 * inside the payload. `generatedAt` is when this file was assembled. A
 * consumer that treats `generatedAt` as the age of the data will be wrong in
 * exactly the way this layer was built to prevent — the file is cached for
 * up to fifteen minutes and a source can lag far longer than that.
 *
 * A reading whose `status` is not "ok" carries no data at all. There is no
 * last-known value kept around to fill the gap: a consumer that needs one
 * must keep it itself, with its own timestamp.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SECRETS
 *
 * Nothing here can carry the AISStream key. It is read once, inside the
 * adapter, and never stored on a Reading; a missing key surfaces only as the
 * NAME of the variable. Keep it that way.
 *
 * Terms travel with the data (`sources[].terms`, `attribution`), because
 * republishing this file republishes GDELT and Open-Meteo data, and both
 * attach conditions to that.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
