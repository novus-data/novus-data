 * Articles and long-term reviews — writing for the site, as distinct from the
 * emailed briefing.
 *
 * Both are published from Beehiiv and filed by their tags (see KIND_TAGS in
 * src/lib/content/types.ts), so this page needs no editing when one is added:
 * sync, and it appears. Reviews lead, because they are the long view a reader
 * cannot get from the monitor or the register; articles follow, newest first.
 *
 * Empty is a real state. The page says there is nothing yet rather than
 * showing a placeholder — Rule 1 forbids fake titles anywhere that could
 * reach production.
