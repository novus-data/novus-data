/**
 * The site is set in one family, and figures are set in its monospace sibling.
 *
 * This reverses the serif/sans split §9 previously described, on the author's
 * instruction — the reasoning is recorded there. The short version: the thing
 * §9 actually blamed for the site reading as generated was *Inter*, the face a
 * generated page reaches for. Plex is the opposite of a default. It is a
 * corporate family with real quirks, and setting every figure in Plex Mono is
 * a terminal convention that no template does by accident.
