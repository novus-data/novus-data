 * Font data for generated images (icons and social cards).

 * generator needs TTF or WOFF and next/font serves WOFF2; a build should not
 * depend on a third-party request succeeding; and the files are small because
 * they are the Latin subset. IBM Plex is an SIL Open Font License family, so
 * redistributing it inside this repository is permitted — the same basis on
 * which Newsreader was committed before it.
 *
 * **These must stay the same family the site sets (§9).** A social card is the
 * part of the site that travels furthest and is judged fastest, and a card in
 * a different typeface from the page it links to reads as two different
 * products. When the site's faces change, change these in the same commit.
