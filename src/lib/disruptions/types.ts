/**
 * The disruption register and the exposure model behind the exposure chart.
 *
 * This is the second typed content layer, built to the pattern CLAUDE.md §14.1
 * lays out: its own types, its own sources, its own public API. It is
 * deliberately NOT merged into the issue content layer — an issue is a document
 * and a disruption is a tracked state with an as-of date, and they fail in
 * different ways.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE IS SO STRICT
 *
 * The exposure chart tells a reader that a named problem reaches a named
 * company. On a site about markets, someone may act on that. So the rule is:
 * a claim that cannot be checked does not render.
 *
 * Every exposure must carry four things or it is dropped at load time, with a
 * warning naming the file:
 *
 *   1. a mechanism  — the sentence explaining HOW the problem reaches the
 *                     company. "Affected" is not a finding; "routes roughly a
 *                     fifth of its Asia–Europe volume through the canal" is.
 *   2. a confidence — whether this is reported, inferred, or estimated.
 *   3. an asOf date — when the assessment was last true.
 *   4. at least one source — with a URL and a publisher.
 *
 * There is no way to produce a coloured cell without all four. That constraint
 * is the product, not an obstacle to it.
